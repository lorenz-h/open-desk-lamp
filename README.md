# Open Desk Lamp
The Xiaomi Desklamp is an affordable connected Lamp that uses an ESP8266 Microcontroller internally. 
Unfortunately, users are required to register for the Xiaomi Home Service and the lamp communicates with Xiaomi servers. 
This project replaces the lamps original firmware with privacy focussed firmware based on [Micropython](https://micropython.org/).
Pinouts for the custom ESP8266 board and other information was taken from fvollmers's 
[open-desk-lamp-firmware](https://github.com/fvollmer/open-desk-lamp-firmware) project, which is written in C and lacks IoT functionality.
